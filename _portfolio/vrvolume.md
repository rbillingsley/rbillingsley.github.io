This project was part of my work as a Summer Research Intern at the University of Hull in 2014. It was to create a volume visualiser for
the output of physics simulations. The goal was to visualise these simulations on Oculus Rift VR hardware
and on the Cube Immersive Display systems within the Departments Immersive Visualisation Environment
(HIVE). Due to the limited time avaliable to complete the project the application was developed using the
Unity3D game engine, which allowed fast iteration and easier deployment onto custom display technology.

This gave me experience developing with Unity3D, and developing for VR hardware/custom display units.
The project created a tool for scientists to visualise their data on a variety of new and engaging mediums,
for me it gave me more experience in creating and "shipping" a project for users in a limited period of time.
