GitHub top is a React app that I built so that I could teach myself about modern JavaScript, Node.js/Yarn, React.js and Mocha.js. This application queries two different versions of the GitHub API for the same information, the top 10 most starred repos on the website. The App queries the v4 GraphQL API, and queries the v3 REST API. The query itself is a basic one, search for the most starred repos and return the top 10, but that query varies widly between the two APIs.

Gaining experience with Node/Yarn, Reach, and Mocha was very enjoyable, as a developer who's focused mainly on C++ and C#, and my most recent HTML and JavaScript experience being [the Orrery in 2012](../orrery/), the amount of progress in the JavaScript language, Tools and workflow is astounding, and it makes for very enjoyable work.
