Amulet is an M-Health reporting app built in 2013 for my third year module "Mobile Devices". The app allows users to log and track the amount of Alcohol they consume and gather data on how that is effecting them. With Amulet the user can register/login, add a drink to their diary and take a few quick tests to self-assess their inebriation.

After adding to their diary, the user can undertake tasks, the Inspection task is a quick game of pairs, the sequence task asks the user to select numbers from a jumbled grid in descending order, and the Pilot task has the user dragging a box around the screen to avoid other bouncing boxes.
