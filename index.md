My name is Russell Billingsley, I'm a Games Programmer with over 3 years experience and a BSc in Computer Science with Games Development.

Whilst in industry I have worked on a variety of game projects of varying scales and team sizes including AAA. I've mostly been working with C/C++ and C# and I've had experience in Tools, Engine, and Gameplay development on multiple platforms, including Windows/Xbox One/PS4/iOS/MacOS and Web.

I've worked as part of a co-development team working with clients in an embedded capacity, and a stand-alone game team working for an external publisher. I've onboarded and mentored multiple junior developers, worked across discipline to improve developers workflows. I continually strive to reduce the amount of friction present in the development environment.

My technical history is graphics and games focused, but I enjoy a wide variety of software development areas, such as web and application development.
